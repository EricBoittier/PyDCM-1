# PyDCM
Combine all models and improve user friendlines of the (Minimal) Distributed Charge Method (MDCM)

The aid is to combine, extend and simplify the application of the MDCM modules (see e.g. https://github.com/MMunibas/MDCM) in one package avaiable by Python-

- Enable arbitrary mutlidimensional QM scan for molecules with a few selection of QM program.
- Fit MDCM model to one or multiple configurations of whole molecules or fragments to match ESP.
- Fit FMDCM model to a reference MDCM model to account the ESP deviation at conformational changes.
- Use the better performance of Fortran code via f2py for time critical steps.
